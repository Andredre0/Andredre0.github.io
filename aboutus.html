            <p>More than just planting tree’s this fantastic project also teaches school children the responsibility to care for something where they will see real results from their efforts and learn why conservation is so important. Supported by The Perfect World Foundation.
                Meikan safaris limited and Piper Mackay Photography are teaming up with Conserve Maasai Mara for the annual tree planting and fundraising project.
                Mayian, who is a Maasai and the founder of Conserve Maasai Mara, has selected 8 schools in the Sekenani area (the lower gate to the Maasai Mara) and Talek to participate. Each school has a about 500 students. The students will not only be helping with the planting of the 10,000.00 trees but will have the responsibility to water and nurture the trees to full growth.
                Each student will have 2-3 trees that is their sole responsibility. We believe this is a magical experience for young children and may produce some of the next conservationist in Kenya. The trees will be planted at the end of April in what should be the start of the big rainy season. At the end of the high season (tourism) and before the short rains in November the team will visit the schools and the children who have done the best job of caring for their personal trees will be selected to go on safari with Meikan Safaris in the Maasai Mara.</p>
