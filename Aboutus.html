    <h1 id="cons">6. Conservation</h1>
    <div class="cons">
        <p>
            With an increasing human population the habitat for wildlife is shrinking all over the world. The conservancies in Kenya have an important role as they have expanded the area of habitat for wildlife beyond the government parks and reserves (which make up less than 8% of the land in Kenya). Wildlife would not survive without the parks, reserves and conservancies which give them a safe haven unlike the area beyond where wild animals which are dangerous to human and livestock or which damage crops or property are likely to be killed causing human wildlife conflicts anywhere that human liv in dense numbers in ever growing villages rearing livestock or engaged in intensive cultivation. Conservancies act as buffer zones between parks and Human settlements designated for environmental and wildlife protection and provide income and sustainable livelihoods to thousands of people in the community. <br>
            Conservation is a positive exercise of skill and insight, not merely an exercise of abstinence and caution. There is simply no issue more important. Conservation is the preservation of human life on earth, and that, above all else, is worth fighting for and conservation is humanity caring for the future. It is that range of biodiversity that we must care for the whole thing rather than just one or two stars. Conservation is a state of harmony between men, wildlife and land.

    <h2 id="enviro">Environmental Conservation</h2>
    <div class="environment">
        <p>
                Education FOR the environment - taking action to restore, grow and protect. <br>
                We work with schools, Women and young people to instil environmental awareness through innovative, community-based learning experiences. Applying skills, knowledge and values to take environmental action and participate in local restoration. Education FOR the environment increases a sense of responsibility, confidence and empowerment through participating in active citizenship and taking collective action to resolve environmental issues  through Tree seedlings planting to mitigate climate change.

        <h2 id="tree">Tree Planting In The Mara 2022-2023</h2>
        <div class="tree">
            <p>
                More than just planting tree’s this fantastic project also teaches school children the responsibility to care for something where they will see real results from their efforts and learn why conservation is so important. Supported by The Perfect World Foundation. <br>
                Meikan safaris limited and Piper Mackay Photography are teaming up with Conserve Maasai Mara for the annual tree planting and fundraising project. <br>
                Mayian, who is a Maasai and the founder of Conserve Maasai Mara, has selected 8 schools in the Sekenani area (the lower gate to the Maasai Mara) and Talek to participate. Each school has a about 500 students. The students will not only be helping with the planting of the 10,000.00 trees but will have the responsibility to water and nurture the trees to full growth.  <br>
                Each student will have 2-3 trees that is their sole responsibility. We believe this is a magical experience for young children and may produce some of the next conservationist in Kenya.  The trees will be planted at the end of April in what should be the start of the big rainy season. At the end of the high season  (tourism) and before the short rains in November the team will visit the schools and the children who have done the best job of caring for their personal trees will be selected to go on safari with Meikan Safaris in the Maasai Mara.

        <h3>Tree seedlings distribution April 2022</h3>
        <div class="seedlings">
             <p>
                 A fixed climatological year is generally used to determine rainy season onset. However, due to changes in climate, the fixed climatological year might not be the right basis for the onset and dates estimation. Usually, in Maasai Mara the onset of a rainy season is early April but this year was different. We are now experiencing onset of rainfall. <br>
                 For us here, in Conserve Maasai Mara it came in handy now that tree planting day is next week 30th April 2022.In preparation for next weekend official event, 10,000 Trees for the Maasai Mara, we started distributing tree seedlings and due to the bad roads conditions, at some points we couldn't reach some of the schools, and we opted to come up with a solution to deliver the tree seedlings on foot to a distance of about one km.

        <h2>Conserve Maasai Mara Organization, Founder and Director Speech at the Organization Gala Dinner event on December 2020.</h2>
        <div class="speech">
             <p>
                "Dear Conservationists, Partners, stakeholders, friends and the board of Conserve Maasai Mara organization, Good evening and welcome. <br>
                Being here tonight, sharing this celebratory Gala Dinner evening with all of you is truly an honor. Looking around this room, I'm filled with inspiration and hope, Yes, we face a daunting global pandemic as eloquently described by our  early speakers, but with hope of a better tomorrow I have no doubt that we are embarking on an age of unprecedented progress. <br>
                I would like to extend a special welcome to several of our many distinguished guests. <br>
                We have the honor of hosting you all, gathered here tonight is an impressive group of leaders that is also very diverse yet for all this rich diversity, there is something that unite us. Despite our myriad occupations we have all chosen to be here now sharing a common perspective and a set of core commitment of CONSERVATION. <br>
                We are here now because we are dissatisfied with the world we live in, and we believe that it's within our power to PROTECT, CONSERVE and PRESERVE our environment and wildlife. <br>
                We are here now because we believe that improving our COMMUNITY is a crucial part of making the world a better place.
                We are here now because we resist the tendency of too many who fail to use their position in leadership to promote the common good and create a peaceful coexistence of human and wildlife and stop human wildlife conflicts, what has been described as a dangerous empathy deficit. <br>
                For many of us these commitments have their roots in personal history that is certainly the case for me.
                There was a story of a young ambitious Maasai boy who grew up with a strong sense of indebtedness of the need to give back and make a positive change in his community. <br>
                But he did not have a clear idea of where this would lead until 2016 when together with other youth started an organization called CONSERVE MAASAI MARA, with the vision, mission and objectives aligned in the <a href="https://conservemaasaimara.org/ ">Website</a> and that boy was me. <br>
                My suggestion is that the people to embrace conservation and to nurture a passion for wildlife conservation, ultimately COMMUNITY- DRIVEN CONSERVATION is the most effective and sustainable option. <br>
                We will always fight for the environment, wildlife and sustainable livelihoods for our community, we are the team" Mayian Joel. Director, Conserve Maasai Mara Org.

        <h3>Role of Women in Environmantal Conservation</h3>
        <div class="roleofwomen">
            <p>
                "Growing population and technological advancement are continuously putting a strain on the environment and on country’s natural resources. Over-exploitation of the country’s resources like land, water, etc. has resulted in degradation of resources. Hence, it is utmost important to conserve and promote the natural resources and environment. Women have direct contact with natural resources like fuel, food and fodder, forest, water and land especially in rural areas where 70% of population reside and directly dependent upon natural resources, Before it was considered that women have no role in environmental conservation and promotion, as well as they were avoided in all major sphere of social life. But after  spreading  awareness  about  their  rights  and  duties  and  taking  cognizance  of  their surrounding they consciously tried to raise voice against environment degradation. Women play a critical role in managing natural resources on family and community levels and are most affected by environmental degradation. In communities around the world, women manage water, sources for fuel, and food, as well as both forests and agricultural terrain. From the high level to the  grassroots, the  1992 UN Earth  Summit, India’s Chipko  movement and  Kenya’s Green  Belt  Movement  all  highlighted  the  role  of  women’s  voices  and  perspectives  in sustainable development. Therefore, conservation of natural resources and promotion of environment  cannot  be  done  without  involving  the  women  in  planning  and  training  for promoting  the  values  for  conservation  and  promotion  of  environment." <br>
                In service to humanity we ourselves feel that what we are doing is just a drop in the ocean, But the ocean would be less because of that missing drop and What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead.

        <h1>7. The Maasai</h1>
    <div class="maasai"> 
        <p>Culture is an integral part of Maasai community, the way they live, the traditions and customs that dominate their live are all part of their culture. This culture promotes conservation since they minimally interact or intervene with wildlife habitats except when grazing livestock which sometimes encroach the parks or reserves leading to conflicts. Our duty is to be an interface, educate and advocate on peaceful and sustainable avenues of mitigating these conflicts.</p>
